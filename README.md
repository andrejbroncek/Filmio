Find Movies And TV Series fast! Filmio is an iOS app for movie enthusiasts, giving easy and fast access to all the movie info you need.

App is written in Swift 3, using [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage), [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON). Data is aquired via OMDB ([Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) API .

UPDATE: OMDB changed their API licencing due to massive API abuse. To use OMDB, you need to aquire your own private API key. Once you do that, in order to make Filmio work, replace the API key located in AppDelegate file with your own. Thank you for your understanding.
